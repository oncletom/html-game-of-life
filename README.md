# HTML Game of Life

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/oncletom/html-game-of-life.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oncletom/html-game-of-life)

This is an implementation of [Conway’s Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using **HTML** and **DOM** manipulations.

It has been coded for the [2011’s edition of the Global Day of Code Retreat in Bordeaux, France](http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-bordeaux-france).

This particular day, I’ve found myself happy to democase the usage of HTML to solve the problem.  
One year later, I feel the code particularly poor despite some nice patterns usage.

## Running Tests

The test suite is runned by [CasperJS testing framework](http://casperjs.org/testing.html) on purpose.

```bash
$ casperjs test tests/
```
